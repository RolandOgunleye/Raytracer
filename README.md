# Raytracer in a Weekend
Implemented raytracer using C++ through following Peter Shirley Raytracer in a Weekend tutorial: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

## What features does the raytracer have?

The raytracer utilizes geometric vectors and colours which are then stored in PPM file to display spheres with different materials such as Metal, Dielectric and Lambertian.

## TODO
* Multithreading to allow quicker rendering 
* Add different colours and shapes
